Question: Predicting Used Car Prices with Linear Regression

You are given a dataset containing information about used cars, including features
such as the car's name, year, selling price, kilometers driven, fuel type, seller type,
transmission type, and owner history. Your goal is to build a linear regression model
to predict the selling price of these used cars based on the given features.

Here are the tasks you need to perform:

Data Preparation:
«Load the dataset.
Perform data cleaning and preprocessing as needed (e.g., handling
missing values, encoding categorical variables, etc.).
Feature Selection:
© Select the relevant features that you believe will influence the selling
price of a used car. Justify your feature selection choices.
Linear Regression Model:
«Build a linear regression model using a suitable library (e..,
scikitlearn).
«Split the dataset into a training set and a testing set (e.g., 80% training
and 20% testing).
«Train the linear regression model using the training data.
Model Evaluation:
Use the trained model to make predictions on the testing data.
«Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate regression
metrics (e.g, Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Squared Error,
Rsquared).
«Visualize the actual vs. predicted selling prices.
Insights and Analysis:
«Interpret the coefficients of the linear regression model to understand
the impact of each feature on the selling price.
Discuss any interesting findings or insights from your analysis.
Optional Enhancement (Bonus):
Try different variations of linear regression (e.g., Ridge, Lasso) and
compare their performance.
«Perform feature engineering to create new features that might improve
model performance.
«Experiment with different train-test split ratios or cross-validation
techniques.
